# nuclear.css

An experiment in generating atomic, immutable, class-based CSS.

## About

CSS frameworks such as [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) and [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) have popularized the concept of using composable, immutable CSS classes to lay the foundation for a stylesheet.

Nuclear provides the basis for **generating a customized set of these classes**, using [Sass maps](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps).

## Usage

Look at the [source](https://github.com/callmecavs/nuclear.css/blob/master/src/nuclear.scss) file, and the unminified [distribution](https://github.com/callmecavs/nuclear.css/blob/master/dist/nuclear.css) file, to understand how the class names are generated.

Edit and recompile the source - using the [Gulpfile](https://github.com/callmecavs/nuclear.css/blob/master/gulpfile.js) if you prefer - to create your own set of classes.
